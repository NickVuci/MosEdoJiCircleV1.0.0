# Code Duplication Issues in MosEdoJiCircleV1.0.0

This document summarizes areas of code duplication in the codebase, listing them by both priority (impact on maintainability and user experience) and by ease of implementation (how quickly they can be refactored). Status for each item is shown below.

---

## Issues by Priority

### High Priority
1. **Tooltip Logic**
   - ✅ Tooltip event handlers are now unified via the shared `attachTooltipHandlers` utility in `utils.js`.
   - All modules (`edo.js`, `mos.js`, `ji.js`) use this for consistent, DRY tooltips.

2. **Input Validation and Correction**
   - ✅ Input validation and correction is unified and config-driven in `main.js`.
   - Minor per-module parsing remains, but is minimal and not error-prone. Further DRYing is possible by moving all parsing to shared utilities if desired.

3. **Error Feedback**
   - ✅ All error feedback is now unified via shared utilities (`showError`, `clearError`, etc.) in `utils.js`. All modules use these for consistent, accessible error display.

### Medium Priority
4. **Label Rendering**
   - ✅ The logic for rendering note labels (position, formatting, style) is now unified across all visualizations using the shared `renderLabels` utility in `utils.js`.
   - All modules (`edo.js`, `mos.js`, `ji.js`) use this utility for consistent appearance and easier updates.

5. **SVG Group and Element Management**
   - ✅ All SVG group and element management is now unified via shared `ensureGroup` and `clearGroup` utilities in `utils.js`. All modules use these for consistent, DRY group logic.

### Lower Priority
6. **Value Clamping and Formatting**
   - ✅ All clamping and formatting logic is now unified via `clamp` and `formatCents` utilities in `utils.js`. All modules use these for DRY value handling.

7. **Checkbox/Event Handler Patterns**
   - ✅ Checkbox and toggle event handling is config-driven and unified in `main.js`.

## Issues by Ease of Implementation

### Easy Fixes
1. **Value Clamping and Formatting**
   - ✅ Done. All modules use the shared utilities.
2. **SVG Group and Element Management**
   - ✅ Done. All modules use the shared utilities.
3. **Checkbox/Event Handler Patterns**
   - ✅ Done. All event handler patterns are config-driven and unified.

### Moderate Effort
4. **Tooltip Logic**
   - ✅ Done. All modules use the shared utility.
5. **Label Rendering**
   - ✅ Done. All modules use the shared utility.
6. **SVG Group and Element Management**
   - ✅ Done. All modules use the shared utilities.
7. **Error Feedback**
   - ✅ Done. All modules use the shared utility for error feedback.

### Significant Effort
6. **Input Validation and Correction**
   - ✅ Mostly done. Only minor per-module parsing remains.


## Summary Table

| Area                | Status         |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Tooltip logic       | ✅ Done        |
| Input validation    | ✅ Mostly done |
| Error feedback      | ✅ Done        |
| Label rendering     | ✅ Done        |
| SVG group mgmt      | ✅ Done        |
| Value clamping      | ✅ Done        |
| Event handler setup | ✅ Done        |


**Recommendation:**
All major code duplication issues are now resolved. The codebase is DRY, maintainable, and easy to extend. Continue to monitor for new duplication as features are added.
