# MosEdoJiCircleV1.0.0 Development Priorities

**Status Summary (as of July 2025):**
- D3.js dependency is now bundled locally (âœ… complete)
- Code duplication (tooltips, SVG group mgmt, error feedback, label rendering, clamping, event patterns) is resolved (âœ… complete)
- Input validation is mostly DRY, but some modules still use direct parsing (ðŸŸ¡ in progress)
- UI state management: MOS text grouping and MOS error feedback are complete; EDO input validation and checkbox feedback still needed (ðŸŸ¡ in progress)
- All other items remain as described below

This document outlines the key issues identified in the current codebase, organized by importance and implementation difficulty.

## Issues By Importance

### High Priority
1. **Missing Sound Integration** - The sound functionality is implemented in `sound.js` but not connected to the UI, making it inaccessible to users. (**Outstanding**)
2. **Error Handling Inconsistencies** - Error handling and input validation are now consistent across all user inputs and modules using the shared utility. (**Complete as of July 2025**)
3. **Performance Concerns** - Inefficient rendering approach for complex visualizations (high EDO values, many JI intervals) could cause performance issues. (**Outstanding**)

### Medium Priority
4. **Inconsistent UI State Management** - Issues like the MOS text remaining visible when the feature is disabled cause confusion. (ðŸŸ¡ MOS text grouping fixed, EDO input validation and checkbox feedback still needed)
5. **Mobile Responsiveness Limitations** - Fixed-size SVG (600x600px) and small touch targets reduce usability on mobile devices. (**Outstanding**)
6. **Code Duplication** - Repeated tooltip code and other duplicated functionality across modules increases maintenance burden. (âœ… Complete)
7. **Accessibility Issues** - Reliance on color for distinguishing components and lack of ARIA attributes limits accessibility. (**Outstanding**)

### Lower Priority
8. **Limited Features** - Missing functionality like saving/sharing configurations would enhance the application. (**Outstanding**)
9. **Dependency Management** - Reliance on an external CDN for D3.js creates a potential point of failure. (âœ… Complete)
10. **Missing Documentation** - Lacks comprehensive documentation explaining the applied mathematical concepts. (**Outstanding**)
11. **Browser Compatibility** - Web Audio API implementation uses some older patterns that might cause issues in certain browsers. (**Outstanding**)
12. **No Testing Framework** - Lack of automated tests for mathematical functions and core functionality. (**Outstanding**)

## Issues By Ease of Implementation

### Easy Fixes
1. **Inconsistent UI State Management** - Quick fixes to ensure UI elements are properly hidden/shown based on toggle states.
2. **Code Duplication** - Refactor repeated code into shared utility functions without major architectural changes.
3. **Missing Documentation** - Add comprehensive comments and documentation to explain complex concepts and calculations.
4. **Dependency Management** - Bundle D3.js with the application rather than using a CDN reference.

### Moderate Effort
5. **Missing Sound Integration** - Connect existing sound functionality to the UI by adding waveform selection controls and play buttons.
6. **Error Handling Inconsistencies** - Implement consistent validation across all user inputs and modules.
7. **Browser Compatibility** - Update Audio API implementation and test across various browsers.
8. **Accessibility Issues** - Add ARIA attributes and improve visual indicators beyond just color changes.

### Significant Effort
9. **Performance Concerns** - Refactor rendering approach to use D3's enter/update/exit pattern efficiently and optimize calculations.
10. **Mobile Responsiveness Limitations** - Redesign the visualization to be fully responsive and touch-friendly.
11. **No Testing Framework** - Implement automated testing for the mathematical functions and core visualization features.
12. **Limited Features** - Add new features like configuration saving/sharing, audio feedback, and enhanced visualizations.

## Implementation Plan

Based on the analysis of importance and effort, the following implementation order is recommended:

1. Fix Inconsistent UI State Management (high impact, low effort)
2. Implement Missing Sound Integration (high impact, medium effort)
3. Address Error Handling Inconsistencies (high impact, medium effort)
4. Reduce Code Duplication (medium impact, low effort)
5. Improve Performance Concerns (high impact, high effort)
6. Enhance Mobile Responsiveness (medium impact, high effort)
7. Add Accessibility Features (medium impact, medium effort)
8. Update Dependency Management (low impact, low effort)
9. Improve Browser Compatibility (low impact, medium effort)
10. Add Missing Documentation (low impact, low effort)
11. Implement Testing Framework (low impact, high effort)
12. Develop Additional Features (medium impact, high effort)

This plan prioritizes high-impact, lower-effort items first, followed by other high-impact items, and finally the lower-impact improvements.
