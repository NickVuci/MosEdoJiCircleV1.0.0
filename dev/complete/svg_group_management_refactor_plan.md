# SVG Group and Element Management Refactor Plan

This plan will unify and DRY all SVG group creation, selection, and clearing logic across the codebase.

---

## Step 1: Analyze Current Code
- ✅ Analyzed all modules. All group creation and clearing is now handled by shared utilities.

---

## Step 2: Design the Utility API
- ✅ Designed the API for `ensureGroup(svg, id)` and `clearGroup(group)`.

**Example usage:**
```js
const group = ensureGroup(svg, 'my-group-id');
clearGroup(group);
```

---

## Step 3: Implement the Utilities
- ✅ Added `ensureGroup` and `clearGroup` to `utils.js` with JSDoc comments.

---

## Step 4: Refactor All Modules
- ✅ All modules (`main.js`, `edo.js`, `mos.js`, `ji.js`) now use `ensureGroup` and `clearGroup` for group management. All manual group creation/clearing code removed.

---

## Step 5: Test Thoroughly
- ✅ All visualizations tested. Groups are created, cleared, and reused correctly. No rendering artifacts or missing elements.

---

## Step 6: Document the Change
- ✅ JSDoc added to the new utilities in `utils.js`.
- ✅ This document and developer documentation updated to describe the new group management pattern.

---

**Result:**  
All SVG group and element management is now DRY, robust, and easy to maintain. Any changes to group logic can be made in one place. This refactor is complete.
