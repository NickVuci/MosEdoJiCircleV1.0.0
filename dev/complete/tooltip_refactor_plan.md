# Refactoring Tooltip Logic: Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps to refactor and unify tooltip logic across all visualization modules in MosEdoJiCircleV1.0.0.

---

## Step 1: Analyze Existing Tooltip Code
- ✅ Reviewed `mos.js`, `edo.js`, and `ji.js` for all instances of tooltip event handler code.

## Step 2: Design a Shared Utility Function
- ✅ Designed and specified the `attachTooltipHandlers(selection, getText)` utility.

## Step 3: Implement the Utility
- ✅ Implemented the utility in `js/utils.js`.

## Step 4: Refactor Each Module
- ✅ All modules (`mos.js`, `edo.js`, `ji.js`) now use the shared utility for tooltips.

## Step 5: Test Thoroughly
- ✅ Verified tooltips appear, update, and disappear correctly in all visualizations.
- ✅ Checked that tooltip content is correct for each module.
- ✅ No regressions in user experience or performance.

## Step 6: Document Usage
- ✅ Added comments and documentation for the utility function in `utils.js`.
- ✅ This document updated to reflect completion.

---

**Result:**
- All tooltip logic is DRY, consistent, and easy to maintain.
- Any future changes to tooltip behavior or styling can be made in one place.
- This refactor is complete.
