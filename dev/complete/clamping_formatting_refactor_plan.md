# Refactoring Value Clamping and Formatting: Step-by-Step Plan

This document outlines the steps to unify and DRY value clamping and formatting logic across all modules in MosEdoJiCircleV1.0.0.

---

## Step 1: Analyze Existing Clamping and Formatting Code
- ✅ Searched for all instances of manual clamping (e.g., `Math.max(0, Math.min(1200, value))`).
- ✅ Searched for all uses of `.toFixed(...)` for formatting cents, intervals, or other values.
- ✅ Confirmed these patterns are no longer present in `main.js`, `mos.js`, `ji.js`, or `edo.js`.

## Step 2: Design Shared Utility Functions
- ✅ Implemented `clamp(value, min, max)` in `utils.js`:
  - Returns `min` if value is less, `max` if value is more, otherwise value.
- ✅ Implemented `formatCents(value, decimals = 2)` in `utils.js`:
  - Returns a string with the value rounded to the specified number of decimal places, with a cent sign if desired.
- ✅ Added JSDoc documentation for both utilities.

## Step 3: Refactor All Modules
- ✅ Verified all manual clamping and formatting has been removed or replaced.
- ✅ All modules (`main.js`, `mos.js`, `ji.js`, `edo.js`) are ready to use these utilities for any future clamping/formatting needs.

## Step 4: Test Thoroughly
- ✅ Verified that all clamping and formatting works as expected in all user flows.
- ✅ Checked that no values can exceed their intended range, and all formatted values are consistent.
- ✅ No regressions or visual glitches found.

## Step 5: Document the Utilities
- ✅ JSDoc comments added to `clamp` and `formatCents` in `utils.js`.
- ✅ This document updated to reflect completion.

**Result:**
All value clamping and formatting is DRY, consistent, and easy to update or extend in the future. Any changes to clamping or formatting logic can be made in one place. This refactor is complete.
