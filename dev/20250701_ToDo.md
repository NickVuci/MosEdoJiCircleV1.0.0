# To-Do: Cost-Benefit Prioritized (as of 2025-07-01)


## Highest Priority (High Impact, Low/Medium Effort)

- Refactor all input parsing and validation in `edo.js`, `ji.js`, and `mos.js` to use the shared `parseInput` utility, eliminating direct use of `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, and manual validation logic.
- Implement robust, consistent validation and user feedback for all numeric inputs (EDO, MOS, JI, etc.) using `showError`/`clearError` and shared error messages from `utils.js`.
- Ensure all error handling and feedback in EDO, MOS, and JI modules use the shared utilityâ€™s error messages and patterns.
- Add a clear visual highlight or descriptive text to the "Labels Always On" checkbox to clarify its effect.
- Test all input fields and UI toggles for consistent behavior and error feedback with both valid and invalid data.
- Mark the input validation and UI state management plans as complete once all above recommendations are implemented.

## High Priority (High Impact, Medium Effort)

- Connect sound functionality in `sound.js` to the UI, including waveform selection controls and play buttons.
- Refactor rendering for better performance with high EDO values and many JI intervals.

## Medium Priority (Medium Impact, Medium/High Effort)

- Make the SVG visualization fully responsive and touch-friendly for mobile devices.
- Add ARIA attributes and improve accessibility beyond color cues.
- Add features for saving/sharing configurations.
- Add comprehensive documentation for mathematical concepts.
- Update Web Audio API implementation for better browser compatibility.

## Lower Priority (Low Impact, High Effort)

- Implement automated tests for mathematical functions and core features.

## Implementation Plan: Highest Priority (High Impact, Low/Medium Effort)

1. **Audit and Refactor Input Parsing:**
   - All input parsing in `edo.js`, `ji.js`, and `mos.js` now uses the shared `parseInput` utility from `utils.js`.
   - All direct use of `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, and manual validation has been eliminated. **(Complete as of July 2025)**

2. **Standardize Validation and Feedback:**
   - All numeric input fields (EDO, MOS, JI, etc.) now use `showError`/`clearError` for user feedback, and all error messages and patterns are standardized via `parseInput` in `utils.js`. **(Complete as of July 2025)**

3. **UI Enhancement for Labels Toggle:**
   - Add a clear visual highlight or descriptive text to the "Labels Always On" checkbox in the UI to clarify its effect.

4. **Comprehensive Testing:**
   - Test all input fields and UI toggles with both valid and invalid data.
   - Confirm consistent error feedback and correct UI state management.

5. **Documentation and Completion:**
   - Mark the input validation and UI state management plans as complete in the relevant documentation once all above steps are implemented and verified.
