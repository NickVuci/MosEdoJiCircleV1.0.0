# To-Do: Cost-Benefit Prioritized (as of 2025-07-01)

## Highest Priority (High Impact, Low/Medium Effort)

- Implement robust validation and user feedback for the EDO input (`#edo-input`), similar to the MOS generator input (use `showError`/`clearError`).
- Refactor `edo.js`, `ji.js`, and `mos.js` to use the shared `parseInput` utility for all user input parsing and validation.
- Remove any remaining direct use of `parseInt`, `parseFloat`, and manual validation logic in these modules.
- Ensure all error handling and feedback uses the shared utilityâ€™s error messages.
- Add a visual highlight or descriptive text to the "Labels Always On" checkbox to make its effect more apparent to users.
- Test all input fields in the UI with valid and invalid data to confirm consistent behavior and error feedback.
- Test toggling the MOS visualization and "Labels Always On" checkbox to ensure all UI elements respond as expected.
- Mark the input validation and UI state management plans as complete once all recommendations are implemented.

## High Priority (High Impact, Medium Effort)

- Implement consistent error handling in EDO and JI modules.
- Connect sound functionality in `sound.js` to the UI (add waveform selection controls and play buttons).
- Refactor rendering for better performance with high EDO values and many JI intervals.

## Medium Priority (Medium Impact, Medium/High Effort)

- Make the SVG visualization fully responsive and touch-friendly for mobile devices.
- Add ARIA attributes and improve accessibility beyond color cues.
- Add features for saving/sharing configurations.
- Add comprehensive documentation for mathematical concepts.
- Update Web Audio API implementation for better browser compatibility.

## Lower Priority (Low Impact, High Effort)

- Implement automated tests for mathematical functions and core features.
