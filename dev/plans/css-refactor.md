# CSS Refactoring Plan

## Goals
- Improve organization and maintainability
- Reduce code duplication
- Enhance responsive design
- Support better mobile experience
- Split into logical modules
- Maintain full compatibility with existing functionality

## Step-by-Step Refactoring Approach

### 1. Initial Setup (Safety Preparation)

- [ ] Create a Git branch for CSS refactoring (`git checkout -b css-refactor`)
- [ ] Ensure all tests are passing before beginning
- [ ] Take screenshots of the current UI in various states for visual regression testing
- [ ] Document current viewport behaviors at different screen sizes

### 2. File Structure Creation

- [x] Create the following directory structure:
  ```
  css/
  ├── base/
  │   ├── variables.css
  │   └── reset.css
  ├── layout/
  │   ├── grid.css
  │   ├── sidebar.css
  │   └── main-content.css
  ├── components/
  │   ├── buttons.css
  │   ├── forms.css
  │   ├── modules.css
  │   └── tooltips.css
  ├── visualization/
  │   ├── svg.css
  │   └── circle.css
  ├── themes/
  │   └── dark-mode.css
  ├── responsive/
  │   ├── landscape.css
  │   └── portrait.css
  └── main.css (imports all others)
  ```

### 3. Extract and Refactor in Phases

#### Phase 1: Extract without Modification
- [x] Move CSS custom properties to `base/variables.css`
- [x] Move global styles to `base/reset.css`
- [x] Extract other sections to their respective files with minimal changes
- [x] Create `main.css` that imports all new files in the correct order
- [x] Update index.html to reference main.css instead of styles.css
- [ ] Test that this extraction alone doesn't break anything

#### Phase 2: Create Common Variables
- [x] Add spacing variables (--space-xs, --space-sm, etc.)
- [x] Add border-radius variables
- [x] Add transition timing variables
- [x] Add font-size and line-height variables
- [x] Replace spacing and border-radius values with variables
- [x] Apply font-size, line-height, and transition variables to components

#### Phase 3: Refactor and Enhance Components
- [x] Create reusable button classes
- [x] Standardize form input styles
- [ ] Improve control module styles
- [ ] Enhance tooltip accessibility and styling

#### Phase 4: Improve Responsive Design
- [ ] Convert to mobile-first approach
- [ ] Add breakpoints for width-based media queries
- [ ] Enhance portrait/landscape mode transitions
- [ ] Add touch-specific enhancements

### 4. Testing Strategy

After each phase:
- [ ] Visual testing with the screenshots from step 1
- [ ] Functional testing of all interactive elements
- [ ] Responsive testing at various viewport sizes
- [ ] Test in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Test dark mode and light mode

### 5. Progressive Enhancement

- [ ] Add new CSS features with appropriate fallbacks:
  - [ ] `clamp()` for responsive sizing
  - [ ] `aspect-ratio` property where beneficial
  - [ ] CSS Grid enhancements

### 6. Documentation Updates

- [ ] Add comments to CSS files explaining the purpose of each section
- [ ] Create a CSS style guide for future development
- [ ] Document the new CSS architecture

## Implementation Order

1. **Base Files**: Extract variables and global styles
2. **Layout Files**: Extract layout structure without changing behavior
3. **Component Files**: Extract component styles preserving current look
4. **Visualization**: Extract SVG and circle styles with special attention to functionality
5. **Theme**: Extract dark mode styles
6. **Responsive**: Extract media queries last, as these often interact with other styles

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Breaking the Visualization Rendering
- **Mitigation**: Keep all SVG-related styles together initially
- **Mitigation**: Test visualization extensively after each change

### Risk: Breaking Responsive Layout
- **Mitigation**: Change one media query at a time
- **Mitigation**: Test on multiple devices and orientations

### Risk: CSS Specificity Issues
- **Mitigation**: Maintain the same selector specificity initially
- **Mitigation**: Document any specificity changes carefully

### Risk: Import Order Affecting Cascade
- **Mitigation**: Document the critical cascade dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Use more specific selectors where order is critical

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:
1. Identify which phase introduced the problem
2. Roll back to the previous working state
3. Take a more incremental approach with smaller changes
4. If necessary, revert to the original CSS file

## Success Criteria

- No visual regression in the UI
- All interactive elements function correctly
- Responsive behavior works as expected or better
- Code is more maintainable with reduced duplication
- CSS files are logically organized
- New CSS architecture is well-documented

This plan prioritizes safety while improving the code structure, ensuring that the refactoring enhances rather than disrupts the application.
