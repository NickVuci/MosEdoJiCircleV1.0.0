# Mobile Responsiveness Plan

## Status Summary (as of July 2025)
- [ ] SVG and UI are not responsive; fixed size and layout limit usability on mobile devices
- [ ] Touch targets are small and not optimized for mobile interaction
- [ ] No mobile-specific layout or controls
- [ ] No viewport meta tag or CSS media queries for scaling

## Overview

The current MosEdoJiCircleV1.0.0 UI uses a fixed-size SVG (600x600px) and desktop-oriented controls, making it difficult to use on mobile devices. Improving mobile responsiveness will increase accessibility, usability, and user satisfaction across devices.

## Current Issues

1. **Fixed-Size SVG**: The main visualization is hardcoded to 600x600px, causing horizontal scrolling and poor fit on small screens.
2. **Small Touch Targets**: Sliders, checkboxes, and buttons are sized for mouse use, not touch.
3. **No Responsive Layout**: Controls and SVG do not rearrange or resize for smaller screens.
4. **No Viewport Meta Tag**: The HTML lacks a viewport tag for proper scaling on mobile.
5. **No Media Queries**: CSS does not adapt font sizes, padding, or layout for mobile.
6. **No Mobile-Specific Controls**: No gestures, larger buttons, or mobile-friendly input types.

## Centered, Uncut, and Stable Circle: Special Considerations

To ensure the main circle is always perfectly centered, fully visible, and stable regardless of screen size or orientation, the following consolidated plan should be followed before any code changes:

### SVG and Visualization
- Use a responsive SVG with `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`.
- Set SVG width/height to 100% of its container, and constrain the container with CSS to avoid overflow.
- Always draw the circle at the center of the SVG (`cx=width/2`, `cy=height/2`).
- Dynamically calculate the radius as the minimum of half the SVGâ€™s width or height, minus a margin for labels.
- On window resize or orientation change, recalculate the SVG size, center, and radius so the circle is never cut off.
- Prevent panning/dragging/zooming on the SVG unless explicitly desired. Use `touch-action: none;` if needed.

### Layout and Controls
- Place all controls (menus, sliders, checkboxes) outside the SVG area, either above, below, or in a sidebar.
- On mobile, stack controls vertically below the SVG using Flexbox or Grid.
- Ensure controls never overlap the SVG/circle. Avoid fixed overlays unless transparent and non-blocking.
- Use CSS to prevent layout shifts and scrollbars. The SVG and controls should always fit within the viewport.

### Implementation Steps (Consolidated)
1. Refactor SVG to use `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`.
2. Set SVG and container to 100% width/height, with CSS constraints.
3. In JS, always center the circle and recalculate radius on resize/orientation change.
4. Move all controls outside the SVG, using a responsive layout.
5. Prevent unwanted touch/pan/zoom on the SVG.
6. Test on various devices and orientations to ensure the circle is always centered, stable, and never cut off.

> **Note:** This plan should be reviewed and agreed upon before starting the refactor, to ensure a robust and user-friendly result.

## Recommended Fixes

1. **Make SVG Responsive**
   - Use `viewBox` and `preserveAspectRatio` on the SVG.
   - Set SVG width/height to 100% and constrain via CSS.
   - Test resizing and scaling on various devices.

2. **Add Viewport Meta Tag**
   - Add `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` to `index.html`.

3. **Improve Touch Targets**
   - Increase size of sliders, checkboxes, and buttons (min 44x44px).
   - Add spacing between controls.

4. **Implement Responsive Layout**
   - Use CSS Flexbox/Grid to rearrange controls below the SVG on small screens.
   - Stack controls vertically and allow SVG to shrink.

5. **Add Media Queries**
   - Adjust font sizes, padding, and margins for screens <600px wide.
   - Hide or collapse less-used controls on mobile.

6. **Mobile-Specific Enhancements**
   - Use `input type="number"` for numeric fields.
   - Consider swipe gestures for navigation or parameter changes.
   - Test with screen readers and on-device emulators.

## Implementation Plan

1. Refactor SVG and container to use `viewBox` and percentage-based sizing.
2. Add viewport meta tag to `index.html`.
3. Update CSS to use Flexbox/Grid and add media queries for mobile breakpoints.
4. Increase touch target sizes and spacing in CSS.
5. Test on multiple devices and browsers; iterate as needed.
6. Gather user feedback and refine.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SVG resizes and remains legible on phones and tablets
- [ ] All controls are easily tappable (min 44x44px)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile
- [ ] Controls rearrange below SVG on small screens
- [ ] Font sizes and spacing are readable on mobile
- [ ] All features remain accessible and usable

This plan will ensure MosEdoJiCircleV1.0.0 is accessible and user-friendly on all devices, laying the groundwork for further improvements in accessibility and usability.
