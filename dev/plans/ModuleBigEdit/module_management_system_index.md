## 🚨 Critical Safety Requirements

**Before ANY implementation begins:**
- [ ] Read and understand [00_CRITICAL_BreakingChangePrevention.md](./00_CRITICAL_BreakingChangePrevention.md)
- [ ] Complete all PreModuleBigEdit preparation tasks
- [ ] Implement state capture/restore utilities
- [ ] Set up DOM compatibility layers
- [ ] Create comprehensive rollback procedures

**Throughout implementation:**
- [ ] Maintain parallel old/new system capability
- [ ] Test breaking change mitigations at each phase
- [ ] Validate rollback procedures work
- [ ] Monitor for memory leaks and performance impact

## 🔧 Development Tools and Testing

### Recommended Development Approach:
1. **Feature Flags**: Use toggles to switch between old/new systems
2. **Parallel Testing**: Keep both systems functional during development
3. **Incremental Validation**: Test each phase thoroughly before proceeding
4. **Rollback Testing**: Verify rollback works at each major milestone

### Testing Checklist:
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Memory usage stable (no leaks)
- [ ] Performance within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Accessibility maintained or improved
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

---

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

**If implementation goes wrong:**
1. **Stop immediately** - Don't compound issues
2. **Activate rollback** - Use prepared rollback procedures
3. **Assess damage** - Determine what broke and why
4. **Re-evaluate** - Review breaking change prevention measures
5. **Get help** - Don't proceed without understanding the issue

**Rollback Triggers:**
- Any functionality completely broken
- User data lost or corrupted
- Performance degraded beyond acceptable levels
- Accessibility seriously compromised
- Memory leaks detected

---

**Note:** This modular approach allows for focused development, parallel work streams, and safe incremental progress with rollback capability at each major milestone. Each document is self-contained but references the overall architecture and safety measures.
