# Low Priority Tasks - Module Management System Prerequisites

These tasks are nice to have but not blocking the implementation. They can be completed after the module system is working to improve performance, compatibility, and maintainability.

## 1. Browser Compatibility Testing

**ENHANCEMENT - ENSURES BROAD SUPPORT**

The drag-and-drop implementation uses modern browser APIs:
- **Action:** Verify compatibility with all target browsers, especially on mobile
- **Consider:** Prepare fallbacks or alternative UI for unsupported environments
- **Focus:** HTML5 Drag and Drop API, CSS Grid, modern JavaScript features

**Tasks:**
- Create browser compatibility matrix
- Test on legacy browsers (if required)
- Document known limitations
- Create fallback strategies for unsupported features

**Target Browsers:**
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

---

## 2. Event System Optimization

**ENHANCEMENT - IMPROVES PERFORMANCE**

Optimize the event system for better performance:
- **Action:** Review event handling patterns for efficiency
- **Consider:** Debouncing, throttling, and event delegation optimizations
- **Focus:** Reduce event listener overhead and improve responsiveness

**Tasks:**
- Profile current event system performance
- Implement event debouncing where appropriate
- Optimize event delegation patterns
- Measure performance improvements

---

## 3. Performance Profiling and Optimization

**ENHANCEMENT - ENSURES SMOOTH OPERATION**

Dynamic module creation may impact performance:
- **Current:** Static DOM elements, minimal DOM manipulation
- **New:** Dynamic creation/destruction of complex module DOM structures
- **Action:** Profile performance impact and optimize if needed

**Tasks:**
- Create performance benchmarks
- Profile module creation/destruction
- Optimize DOM manipulation patterns
- Implement lazy loading if beneficial
- Memory usage analysis

**Performance Targets:**
- Module expand/collapse: < 16ms (60fps)
- Drag operations: smooth without janky movements
- Memory usage: no significant leaks
- Initial load time: no regression

## 4. Module Integration Planning

**ENHANCEMENT - IMPROVES ARCHITECTURE**

Plan the detailed integration of each visualization module:
- **Action:** Analyze how each module currently handles rendering and state
- **Focus:** Clean separation of concerns and optimal data flow
- **Goal:** Minimize coupling between modules

**Tasks:**
- Document current module dependencies
- Design clean interfaces between modules
- Plan data flow optimization
- Create module architecture guidelines

---

## 5. Advanced Error Recovery

**ENHANCEMENT - IMPROVES RELIABILITY**

Implement robust error handling and recovery:
- **Action:** Create error boundaries for module failures
- **Consider:** Graceful degradation when modules fail
- **Goal:** System remains functional even if individual modules fail

**Tasks:**
- Implement module error boundaries
- Create fallback rendering modes
- Add error reporting and logging
- Test error recovery scenarios

---

## 6. Development Tools and Debugging

**ENHANCEMENT - IMPROVES DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE**

Create tools to help with module system development:
- **Action:** Build debugging tools for module states
- **Consider:** Browser extension or dev panel
- **Goal:** Easy troubleshooting and development

**Tasks:**
- Create module state inspector
- Add debug logging modes
- Build development utilities
- Create troubleshooting guides

---

## 7. Advanced Accessibility Features

**ENHANCEMENT - IMPROVES INCLUSION**

Beyond basic accessibility, add advanced features:
- **Action:** Implement advanced screen reader support
- **Consider:** High contrast modes, reduced motion support
- **Goal:** Excellent accessibility experience

**Tasks:**
- Implement advanced ARIA patterns
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Test with multiple assistive technologies

---

## 8. Documentation and Training Materials

**ENHANCEMENT - IMPROVES MAINTAINABILITY**

Create comprehensive documentation:
- **Action:** Document the module system architecture
- **Include:** API documentation, usage examples, troubleshooting
- **Goal:** Easy onboarding for future developers

**Tasks:**
- Write architecture documentation
- Create API reference
- Build usage examples
- Record video tutorials

## Risk Assessment

**If these tasks are skipped:**
- Reduced compatibility with some browsers
- Suboptimal performance in some scenarios
- More difficult maintenance and debugging
- Less inclusive user experience

**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 weeks after main implementation

**When to Complete:** After the module system is fully functional and deployed. These can be done as iterative improvements.

## Prioritization Within Low Priority

1. **Performance Profiling** - Most likely to reveal issues
2. **Browser Compatibility** - Important for user reach
3. **Documentation** - Critical for long-term maintenance
4. **Advanced Accessibility** - Important for inclusion
5. **Development Tools** - Helpful for future development
6. **Error Recovery** - Good for reliability
7. **Event Optimization** - Nice performance improvement
8. **Module Integration Planning** - Architectural refinement

---

**Next Steps:** Complete these after the main module system is working and deployed successfully.
